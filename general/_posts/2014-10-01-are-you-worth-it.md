The current challenge i'm having with software is that it's hard to know when you're qualified, i've recently made the shift from being a software university student to frantically trying to get a job in software and it's difficult.

That being said, before a group of trolls dive down my throat with their ever important fact that "nothing is easy" let me make it clear that the reason i'm finding it difficult isn't because of the work I need to put in developing, it's figuring out if i've learned the skills I need and if i'm ready to make the step into the development world.

It's common knowledge that in the development world you'll never be done improving your skill set, but when is it safe to say you have the right skills for the job? 

I haven't figured out the answer to that question yet but when I do i'll make sure to inform you all, in the meantime i'll give you a list of tasks that you can start working through to help ensure you have the skills needed to get a development job, extracted from the wonderful blog of [Chris Oliver][Oliver]

1. Simple blog with comments
2. Pastebin that has short urls (Google some short url algorithms)
3. Make a todo list website (without Javascript)
4. Go back and add authentication (I used devise) to #1 and #2
5. Build a site to send text messages for you using Twilio
6. Create a small site to upload files to using Amazon S3′s free account
7. Go Back to #3 and Ajaxify it all. Add user accounts (with email reminders). I built Fluttrly.com somewhat like this.
8. Build your own JSON and XML API onto #3 or any of the other sites
9. Now take that API you just built and create a Ruby gem out of it using ActiveResource
10. Certainly by now you should have come up with some ideas of your own that you’d like to build. If not, go build an expense tracker with pretty graphs and export to CSV or Freshbooks functionality.
